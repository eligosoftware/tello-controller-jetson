Tello-python installation (Windows)

```bash
>> git clone https://github.com/harleylara/tello-python.git
>> cd tello-python
>> python setup.py install `
```
Tello-python installation (Linux)

```bash

## Running

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eligosoftware/tello-controller.git
cd tello-controller
python main.py
```

## Settings

In the Settings menu it is possible to set the drone IP address, movement and angle step values. The standard IP is 192.168.10.1 for the station mode. User should change the IP if the drone is in AP mode. Move and angle step affect the drone movement behaviour. See more in Control part. The new settings take place only when the app is launched again.
